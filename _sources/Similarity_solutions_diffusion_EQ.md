# The similarity solutions

We want to show that the similarity solutions is closely related to the *intermediate asymptotic solution of the first kind*.

## The diffusion equation

Consider the one-dimensional diffusion equation:

$$
 \partial_t u(x,t)=\frac{\kappa}{2} \partial_x^2 u(x,t)
$$

with initial condition

$$
u(x,t=0)=\frac{A_0}{\sqrt{2\pi l^2}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2l^2}}\text{.}
$$

Here, $A_0$ is the mass which represent the area below $u(x,t)$. The mass is a conserved quantity during the evolution governed by the diffusion equation. We need to specify
